# Placeholder for brand icon
# 
# This file serves as a placeholder to demonstrate the brands directory structure.
# In a real implementation, you would need to:
#
# 1. Create a proper 256x256 PNG icon representing Wolt Watch
# 2. Ensure it meets Home Assistant brand requirements:
#    - Square aspect ratio (256x256)
#    - PNG format
#    - Optimized for web
#    - Transparent background preferred
#    - Properly trimmed with minimal empty space
#
# 3. Optionally create additional files:
#    - logo.png (landscape logo)
#    - icon@2x.png (512x512 hDPI version)
#    - logo@2x.png (hDPI logo version)
#    - dark_icon.png (dark theme optimized)
#    - dark_logo.png (dark theme logo)
#
# 4. Submit to home-assistant/brands repository following their guidelines
#
# For now, this placeholder demonstrates the correct file structure.
