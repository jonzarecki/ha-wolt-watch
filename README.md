## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. **Install the repository**:
   - Click the badge above or manually add this repository to HACS
   - Restart Home Assistant

2. **Add the dashboard card**:
   - Go to your dashboard in edit mode
   - Click "Add Card" ‚Üí Search for "Wolt Watch Card"
   - Add the card to your dashboard

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/wolt_watch` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Copy `www/wolt-watch-card.js` to your `www` directory  
3. Add the card resource in your dashboard configuration:
   ```yaml
   resources:
     - url: /local/wolt-watch-card.js
       type: module
   ```
4. Restart Home Assistant

## Usage

### Using the Dashboard Card

1. **Find your restaurant slug**: 
   - Go to Wolt website/app
   - Navigate to your desired restaurant
   - Copy the slug from the URL (e.g., `taizu`, `mcdonalds-dizengoff`)

2. **Configure the watch**:
   - Enter the restaurant slug
   - Set how long to watch (default 2 hours)
   - Select your mobile device for notifications

3. **Start watching**: Click "Start Watching" and you'll get a notification when the restaurant opens

### Using the Service Directly

You can also call the service directly in automations or scripts:

```yaml
service: wolt_watch.start
data:
  slug: "taizu"
  timeout_m: 30  # 30 minutes
  device: "notify.mobile_app_iphone"
```

### Service Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `slug` | string | Yes | - | Restaurant identifier from Wolt URL |
| `timeout_m` | integer | No | 30 | Watch duration in minutes (1-1440) |
| `device` | string | Yes | - | Notify service entity (e.g., `notify.mobile_app_*`) |

## Finding Restaurant Slugs

Restaurant slugs can be found in the Wolt URL. For example:
- `https://wolt.com/en/isr/tel-aviv/restaurant/taizu` ‚Üí slug is `taizu`
- `https://wolt.com/en/isr/tel-aviv/restaurant/mcdonalds-dizengoff` ‚Üí slug is `mcdonalds-dizengoff`

## How It Works

1. **Polling**: The integration polls the Wolt API every 60 seconds
2. **State tracking**: It remembers if the restaurant was already open to avoid duplicate notifications
3. **Smart notifications**: Only sends notification on the first "closed ‚Üí open" transition
4. **Auto cleanup**: Tasks automatically terminate after timeout or successful notification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Integration not loading:**
- Check that `wolt-sdk` is properly installed: `pip install wolt-sdk`
- Verify all files are in the correct directories
- Check Home Assistant logs for error messages
- Restart Home Assistant after installation

**No notifications received:**
- Verify your mobile device entity ID is correct (check Developer Tools ‚Üí States)
- Check that Mobile App integration is working
- Test notifications with Developer Tools ‚Üí Services
- Ensure device format is correct: `notify.mobile_app_yourdevice`

**Restaurant not found:**
- Double-check the restaurant slug from the Wolt URL
- Ensure the restaurant is available in your location
- Try a different restaurant to test functionality
- Check if the restaurant has regular opening hours

**HACS Installation Issues:**
- Ensure you have HACS installed and configured
- Check that your Home Assistant version is 2024.1.0 or newer
- Clear browser cache if the integration doesn't appear in UI

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.wolt_watch: debug
```

## Rate Limiting

The integration is designed to be respectful of Wolt's API:
- Polls every 60 seconds (configurable in code)
- Backs off to 90 seconds on API errors
- Terminates automatically to avoid indefinite polling
